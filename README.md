# Personal Portfolio v1

This is the first version of my personal portfolio. It is built using Gatsby for SEO and performance. It also currently has some support for a future blog (with dedicated pages per post) through automatic redeployment on Netlify when a new post is detected on my (currently unused) Medium page.

Live version can be accessed at www.alamoodi.io

## Technologies Used

- Gatsby.js (JavaScript framework)
- HTML
- SCSS
- Email.js (Handles email form)
- Netlify (Host the live site)
